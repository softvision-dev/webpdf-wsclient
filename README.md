# webPDF wsclient
This repository contains a simplified and optimized client library for the webPDF server, and serves as an alternative to more complex REST or SOAP APIs.
The library implements the required stubs and session management in ready-to-use interface classes and provides a common object based parameterization for webservice calls in both protocols.
